# dense-landmark-location-demo
demo.mp4 is a short video which shows the results of face alignment on video using our method CFT[1] and RCPR [2] respectively.

Note:
1. Both methods process frame by frame without post processing.

2. We first use our own face detector to detect the faces in the frame and then process face alignment for each face.
